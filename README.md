# Unknown Dev Conference

Study project based on [React Native (0.48.4)](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/v0.48.4). I've started this project to learn React Native (obviously), but also I wanted to know about full process of development a whole application.

### Start a project

First of all you'll need to install globally `node`, `watchman` and `react-native-cli`. Then you need to install all dependecies. Just type `yarn`. Type `yarn start` to start a project.

Also I use [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) for debugging and [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) as default terminal.
