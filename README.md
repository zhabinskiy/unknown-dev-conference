# Unknown Dev Conference

Study project based on [React Native (0.48.4)](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/v0.48.4). I've started this project to learn React Native and understand the development process of full application.

### Start a project

First of all you'll need to install globally `node`, `watchman` and `react-native-cli`. Then you need to install all project dependecies via `yarn`. Type `yarn start` to start a project.

Also I use [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) for debugging and [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) as default terminal.

### Technologies I used

* [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

* [RN Facebook SDK](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-fbsdk)
* [RN Navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation)
* [ESLint with Airbnb config](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* [AsyncStorage](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/next/docs/asyncstorage.html)
